        <div class="para1">History of the University Department of Marathi is as old as the History of the Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College. The Department of Marathi was a part and parcel of the Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College since 1916. Prof. Vaman Malhar Joshi, a great litterateur, was colleague of Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve and was associated with his life mission. Very brilliant students like Godavari Ketkar, Krishnabai Khare, Balutai Khare were the students who graduated from the Women’s University in the first few years. </div>

        <div class="para2">Department of Marathi in Mumbai was established in 1954. It received help and guidance from Prof. N. R. Phatak, Prof V. G. Maydeo, Prof. Madhav Manohar, all the eminent personalities in the Literary world of Marathi.</div>
            
        <div class="para3">Dr. Sakharam Gangadhar Malashe, an eminent scholar and a researcher in true sense of the term, did establish the department on a solid foundation after accepting the Headship in 1968. His tremendous efforts and zeal in pursuing the study of Modern Linguistics inspired his collegues to learn the Descriptive Linguistics of Marathi. This indeed was a pioneering work of Dr, Malashe to have started the teaching of this discipline. All the Universities in Maharashtra in due course followed the foot-steps of the Department of Marathi of Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College</div>
        
        <div class="para4">Dr. Vijaya Rajadhyaksha became head of the department in 1990. The Department witnessed a spell of vigorous activity during her regime. She gave wide publicity to the activities of the department. The department completed two research projects under her leadership and the findings were published in form of books. Dr. Vijaya Rajadhyaksha took a major lead in starting Dr.S.G.Malashe Research Centre at S.N.D.T. Women’s University.</div>
        
        <div class="para5">Thus, this department with such a long tradition is making steady progress in the direction of fulfilling the promises it has held out so far.</div>
