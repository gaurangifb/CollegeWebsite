    <h1>Computer Science | Bachelor of Science | B.Sc </h1>

        <div class="para1">The Computer Science department was established in 1999. The B.Sc CS (60 Students) was introduced in 1999 and M.Sc CS (40 Seats) was introduced in 2001. This programme is designed to complement requirements of the computing Industry by incorporating well designed curriculum which will empower its students and make them confident to stand in the competitive world.</div>

        <div class="para2">The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Honours degree program is a six semester- three year programme. The First year provides the foundations of important computational and mathematical skills required for software development. The course is also supported by business communication to make the learners develop the much required communication skills in the industry. The Second year of this degree programme focusses on core Computer Science with a balance of subjects including computer networks, programming, web technologies etc. The Third year deals with advanced topics including discipline specific electives which give the student an opportunity to specialize in the subject of their choice. It helps them to develop capabilities for designing and formulating computing models and also developing the applications in diverse areas. </div>
