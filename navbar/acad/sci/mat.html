    <h1>Mathematics | Bachelor of Science | B.Sc </h1>

    <div class="para1">Some people feel that Mathematics problems have no real use in life. This couldnâ€™t be further from the truth.  Mathematics is very important in our lives and without realizing it, we use mathematical ideas in solving daily problems. The concepts of mathematics govern everything around us, and without a good understanding of them, one could encounter significant hurdles in life. Studying Mathematics helps one to develop skills in logical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making, which are valued by employers across many job sectors.</div>

    <div class="para2">A good mathematician reduces any system to a set of equations which then is solved based on the constraints placed by the system. One can pursue his/her PhD in a challenging area like financial research or algorithm development in Communications or signal processing and achieve remarkable success. Engineering fields like AI, machine learning, cryptography and communications require mathematicians. Video game developers and computer animators are just two examples among many that use calculus.</div>

    <div class="para3">A degree in Mathematics opens lots of doors. Employers trust Mathematics majors for their smartness and ability to learn new abstract ideas. Insurance companies, engineering firms, software companies, the FBI, NSA, CIA, and schools all need and value people with expertise in mathematics. The pay ranges, job security is usually excellent, level of challenge and interest is usually good to excellent. Mathematics is a multi-faceted subject that emphasizes logic and encourages innovation. The ability to apply mathematical concepts and principles can be useful in virtually any industry. There are many options after B.Sc./M.Sc. few of which is listed below:

    <ul>
        <li>Research Scientist(Mathematics)</li>
        <li>MSc and MBA</li>
        <li>Banking</li>
